# Roadmap — v1.0 "world-class" pass

Status legend: ☐ not started · ◐ in progress · ☑ done. Decisions taken are recorded so the reasoning survives.

## Decisions

Decisions live in [docs/decisions.md](decisions.md) — the canonical, append-only log of
every contestable call and why it was made. The entries that used to be listed here have
moved there unchanged. Record new ones there, not in this file: the roadmap is a build log
and gets rewritten each phase, the decision log does not.

## Governance-framework alignment (v1.5 – v1.6) — shipped

A public-sector data-governance framework arrived 2026-08-18 and the content model, the
site and the review workflow were aligned to it field by field, adding and never deleting.
The plan document moved out with the catalog it was written for (see CHANGELOG); waves 1–3
shipped as v1.5.0 and wave 4 as v1.6.0 (phases 11 and 12 below).

## v1.9.0 release-candidate shakedown — open findings

Found while operating the rc.3–rc.5 deployment; to be resolved (or explicitly deferred)
before stable v1.9.0. The full rc shakedown ledger is still owed to this file.

- **`_data/derivatives.json` is a merge-conflict magnet.** Every content PR's media
  workflow writes derivative entries into one shared manifest, so any two content PRs
  open at the same time conflict on it — the second merge needs a by-hand union of the
  JSON (observed 2026-08-26 with three entry PRs queued). Fix candidates: per-entry
  manifest fragments merged at build time, or a custom merge driver shipped in
  `.gitattributes`.
- **Sourcery's review product ignores the shipped `.sourcery.yaml`.** The
  `github: ignore_labels` key only reaches the legacy bot; a labeled content PR was
  still reviewed with the file on the default branch (2026-08-26). The working control
  is the Sourcery dashboard's "Ignore title keywords" — documented in the admin guide
  and `AGENTS.md`; decide whether the file is worth keeping as intent documentation.
- **Branch protection with "require branches to be up to date" makes content queues
  painful.** Each merge strands every other open content PR on "branch is out-of-date";
  a maintainer who was told to just review-and-merge cannot recover without the update
  button. Recommend non-strict required checks for content-repo rulesets in the docs.

## Content model v2 (AI-use-case preset) — target field list

organization · solution_type · **area** · **ai_role** · **ai_types** · ai_tools · **platform** · **expertise** · **readiness** · **data_sensitivity** · **audience** · stage · **impact** · repo_url · demo_url · docs_url · **resources** (links) · **screenshots** (images) · vendor · data_sources · contact_name · contact_email · deck_pdf · body

v1.3 added the "What it took" group (cost_band · run_cost · procurement · approvals · equity_note). v1.5 (governance alignment) adds use_case_category · review_status (maintainer-only, drives deprecation) · license · access_terms · portability · portability_notes · no_pii_attestation · data_governance_notes · contact_title; v1.6 adds reused_from — 41 fields in eight groups; the current table is in [content-model.md](content-model.md#shipped-fields-ai-use-case-catalog).
