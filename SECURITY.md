# Security

This is a Jekyll site published by GitHub Pages. There is no server, no
database and no user session: the whole site is static files, and every change
to it arrives as a commit on the default branch.

What follows is the trust model — what the automation assumes about the people
who use it, and what it does not assume.

## Where untrusted input enters

One place: **GitHub issues**. Anyone with a GitHub account can open one, and
several workflows react to them. The submission form at `/submit/` does not
send anything anywhere; it composes a prefilled issue URL and the submitter
presses the button on GitHub.

Everything below is about keeping that input from turning into anything more
than text in a pull request.

## What the automation guarantees

**Issue content never executes.**
Issue bodies and titles reach a workflow step only through `env:`, never
interpolated into a `run:` script, so shell metacharacters in a submission are
inert. Nothing a submitter writes is passed to `eval`, a shell, or a template
that renders it as code.

**The generated page is not run through Liquid.**
A scaffolded entry carries `render_with_liquid: false` in its front matter.
Without it, Jekyll would evaluate the page body at build time and a Liquid tag
typed into a write-up would execute against the site's data. `check_front_matter.rb`
warns about any entry that is missing the flag.

**The scaffolder writes inside one folder.**
`scripts/new_entry_from_issue.mjs` derives a slug, re-checks it against
`^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, and then resolves every path it is about to
write and refuses anything that does not sit under `catalog/<slug>/` — file
writes and image downloads alike.

**The issue-form parser is hard to spoof.**
A GitHub issue form renders as `### <label>` sections in template order. The
parser takes the first occurrence of each known heading and treats everything
after the final free-form section as prose, so a `### Contact email` typed
inside someone's write-up cannot overwrite the answer GitHub collected.
Repeated headings are reported on the pull request, not silently applied.
This holds for a body GitHub rendered from the form; an issue written by hand
(or edited afterwards) is still parsed, so the pull request — not the parser —
is the trust boundary.

**Images are fetched behind an SSRF guard.**
Before each request — and again after every redirect hop, up to five — the
target host is resolved and refused if any resolved address is loopback,
link-local (including the cloud metadata address at `169.254.169.254`),
private, unique-local, multicast or unspecified, or if the hostname ends in
`.internal`, `.local` or `localhost`. IP-literal URLs go through the same
check, and IPv6 literals are judged numerically — an IPv4-mapped,
IPv4-compatible or NAT64 address is decoded and held to the IPv4 rules,
whatever its spelling. Redirects are followed by hand so a credential is never
carried to a host it was not meant for. Downloads are capped by count, by total size and by
a request timeout that covers the response body, and each file must be a PNG,
JPEG, GIF or WebP by both its `Content-Type` and its magic bytes before it is
written.

**The cohort and event automation holds to the same rules.**
It reads issue bodies with the same first-occurrence-wins heading parser: only
a heading belonging to the relevant issue form starts a section, and
everything after the form's trailing free-text field is treated as prose, so a
`###` heading typed inside an answer does not replace the answer GitHub itself
collected. Every cohort year and event id is checked against `^\d{4}$` and
`^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, and the resolved path is re-checked to be inside
`cohorts/<year>/events/` before any file is read or written. The front matter
these scripts generate comes from the shared YAML emitter, so quotes, control
characters and Unicode line separators survive a round trip through both Psych
and js-yaml. Every `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` value is written as a heredoc whose
delimiter is random per write, so no answer can forge an additional step
output, and the four workflows declare `permissions: {}` at the top level and
honour the `SUBMISSIONS_OPEN` repository variable.

**Values written into YAML are quoted unless provably safe.**
`scripts/lib/yaml.mjs` emits a plain scalar only for prose-shaped values and
double-quotes everything else, escaping control characters. A submitted value
cannot change the type or the structure of the front matter it lands in.

**Nothing publishes itself.**
Every issue-driven workflow ends at a pull request. A maintainer reviews and
merges it, and only then does the site rebuild. The `contents: write` token is
repository-wide (GitHub has no branch-scoped token), so the workflows confine
themselves by construction: each pushes only to a branch it created for that
issue. The one workflow that commits to an existing branch is `thumbnails.yml`,
which renders PDF thumbnails onto a pull request's own head branch — or, when a
maintainer runs it by hand, onto the branch they chose — and adds only derived
`.jpg` files under the entry folder. Branch protection on the default branch is
the backstop; see "What you should still do" below.

**The optional `CONTENT_BOT_TOKEN` is a deliberate delegation.**
By default the content workflows use the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which cannot
trigger other workflows, so they dispatch the validation checks against the new
branch by hand. A maintainer may instead add a `CONTENT_BOT_TOKEN` secret so the
pull requests are opened as that token's user and trigger checks normally. That
token is a real user's credential rather than a per-run one: scope it to this
repository and to **Contents: write** and **Pull requests: write** only, give it
a short expiry, and prefer a machine account. The workflows read it as
`secrets.CONTENT_BOT_TOKEN || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`, so removing the secret
returns them to the default path with no other change.
See [docs/admin-guide.md](docs/admin-guide.md#checks-on-a-generated-pull-request).

**Third-party actions are pinned.**
Every `uses:` in `.github/workflows/` names a full commit SHA with the release
tag in a trailing comment. Dependabot proposes updates weekly.

## Who can submit

Open by default: the catalog is meant to collect work from people without
write access. To restrict it, set the repository variable `SUBMISSIONS_OPEN` to
`false` (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables). Every
issue-driven workflow (`new-entry`, `new-event`, `new-year`, `update-schedule`,
`update-event-attachments`) then runs only for issues opened by the repository
owner, an organization member or a collaborator. See
[docs/admin-guide.md](docs/admin-guide.md) for the maintainer view.

`apply-setup` is the exception, and is not governed by that variable: the YAML
it applies *becomes* the site's configuration, so the workflow refuses to run
for anyone outside `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR` whatever `SUBMISSIONS_OPEN`
says. Its blast radius is bounded the same way everything else is —
`renderFiles()` returns a fixed set of seven repo-relative paths, so the script
cannot write outside them, and the result is still only a pull request.

## What you should still do

- **Protect the default branch.** Require a pull request before merging
  (Settings → Branches). The automation never targets the default branch, but
  the workflow token *could*, and branch protection is what turns "never does"
  into "cannot".
- **Review the generated pull request as content.** The checklist on it is the
  last look a submission gets before it is published.
- **Watch the Actions tab occasionally.** A workflow that fails on an issue
  posts a comment on that issue; one that fails before it can comment only
  shows up in Actions.

## Known limitations

- **DNS rebinding.** The image fetcher resolves the host, checks every address,
  and then lets `fetch` resolve it again for the actual request. A DNS name
  that flips from a public to a private address between those two lookups
  could reach an internal host of the runner. GitHub-hosted runners have no
  interesting internal hosts, but a self-hosted runner does — put it on a
  network segment with nothing to reach, or drop the `images` field from
  `_data/schema.yml` and let maintainers add screenshots on the pull request.
- **The runner's own network.** The SSRF guard is an allow-list of address
  classes, not a proxy; anything routable and public is fetchable, which is the
  point.

## What is out of scope

- Content accuracy. Maintainers review submissions; the automation does not.
- Anything a maintainer merges by hand. The review checklist on each generated
  pull request is the control there.
- Denial of service against GitHub Actions minutes. The workflows use a
  per-issue `concurrency` group so re-runs replace each other rather than
  stacking, but a determined spammer can still consume minutes; disable the
  workflow or set `SUBMISSIONS_OPEN=false` if that happens.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report privately rather than opening a public issue. Use GitHub's
private vulnerability reporting: the **Security** tab of this repository →
**Report a vulnerability**. (A repository admin enables it under Settings →
Advanced Security → Private vulnerability reporting.) See
[GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
for what the reporting form looks like.

If private reporting is not enabled, email the address in
`_data/site.yml` → `organization.contact_email` and say that the report is a
security issue, so it is not handled as a normal submission.

Expect an acknowledgement within a few working days. There is no bounty.

Something published that should not have been — a takedown request, a leaked
email address, protected data in a screenshot — is not a vulnerability report;
follow [docs/incidents.md](docs/incidents.md), which covers removing the page,
purging it from git history, and asking GitHub Support to clear the caches.
