/**
 * "Also deployed by": attach one organization to an entry somebody else wrote.
 *
 * Input (env): ISSUE_BODY, ISSUE_NUMBER
 * Output:      rewrites <entry path>/<slug>/index.md, appending (or updating)
 *              one item in the `links` field named by `entry.deployments_key`
 *              $GITHUB_OUTPUT: outcome, and per outcome —
 *                added → slug, file, branch, title, org, entry_url, action
 *                none  → reason (a whole sentence the workflow quotes back)
 *              error, when the slug is not a usable path segment.
 *
 * The form is .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/also-deployed-by.yml and the entry page
 * links to it with the slug already filled in (_layouts/entry.html).
 *
 * Why this exists as its own flow rather than as a field on the entry form: the
 * organization that redeployed a use case is not the organization that wrote
 * the entry, and asking them to author a full second entry to say "we run this
 * too" is how the fact never gets recorded. Four boxes is the whole cost.
 *
 * No field key is named here. The target field comes from
 * `_data/schema.yml`'s `entry.deployments_key`, the same pointer idiom as
 * `status_key` and `submitter_key`; a schema without it has not configured the
 * feature, and this script says so rather than inventing a key.
 *
 * Anyone can open the issue that starts this job, so the slug is
 * pattern-checked and the resolved path re-checked against the entry directory
 * before any file is read or written, the issue text reaches the workflow only
 * through outputs written with random heredoc delimiters, and the front matter
 * is spliced line-wise — only the target key's block is re-emitted, everything
 * else passes through verbatim, so comments and key order survive.
