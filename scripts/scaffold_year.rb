# Scaffold a cohort/program year: the landing page and a starter schedule data
# file. Existing files are never overwritten. No events folder is created:
# _plugins/events.rb generates a detail page for every event in the data file,
# and a hand-written file under cohorts/<year>/events/<id>/ overrides it.
#
# Invoked by: the "Scaffold cohort" step in .github/workflows/new-year.yml,
# triggered by an issue labeled `content:new-year` (year read from the issue
# via scripts/extract_event_fields.mjs) or a manual `workflow_dispatch`. That
# workflow opens a PR with the scaffolded files afterwards.
# Env: COHORT_YEAR (required, four digits), COHORT_INTRO (optional).
# Output: writes cohorts/<year>/index.md and _data/cohorts/<year>.yml under the
# repo root; prints a summary line. Outputs (via GITHUB_OUTPUT): created
# ("true" when either file was written, "false" when the year already existed),
# and `error` on a refusal — the workflow quotes that one back onto the issue.

# with String#inspect, which produces escapes YAML does not define (`\#{`,
# `\u{1f600}`) and leaves DEL and the C1 block raw — a crafted intro could
# write a cohort landing page Psych then refuses to parse. Letting Psych do the
# escaping makes every input round-trip.
