# Generates /search.json for the client-side Lunr search. Which fields are
# indexed comes from _data/schema.yml (fields with `search: true` or
# `facet: true`); title and summary are always separate indexed fields. Events
# and cohort pages are indexed too so site search finds them.
#
# Each entry doc is {id, title, summary, facets, sections, url, kind}:
#
#   facets    the schema field values as one string, indexed as its own lunr
#             field so a facet hit can be boosted differently from prose.
#   sections  the write-up split on its `##` headings — [{h: "How to reuse",
#             a: "how-to-reuse", t: "…"}] — so a body hit can name the section
#             it came from and deep-link to it. `a` is the anchor kramdown
#             generates for that heading, which is also what _includes/toc.html
#             links to.
#
# Beside the docs the payload carries two query-side widenings, both read by
# assets/js/search.js and neither able to reorder a literal hit:
#
#   synonyms  the editor's word pairs from _data/search.yml.
#   concepts  term relatedness DERIVED FROM THIS CATALOG'S OWN PROSE — the words
#             that keep turning up in the same entries without simply being
#             common everywhere. See `concept_terms`. Tuned (or switched off)
#             under `concepts:` in _data/search.yml.
#
# Title and summary are deliberately NOT copied into the body text: they are
# already indexed fields, and duplicating them scored every title term three
# times and made the boosts impossible to reason about. The whole write-up is
# indexed by default — the sections that used to fall off the end of a 2,000
# character cap were "Lessons learned" and "How to reuse", which is the content
# a reuse catalog exists to surface. `schema.search.body_chars` caps it again
# for very large catalogs (0 = unlimited).
#
# SearchIndexGenerator runs as a Jekyll::Generator (`generate` hook, priority
# :low so it runs after other generators/pages have populated `site.pages`,
# e.g. entry/event/cohort pages). Input: `site.data["schema"]["fields"]` and
# the rendered `site.pages` (title/summary/body front matter). Output: a
# SearchIndexFile added to `site.static_files`, written to `/search.json` at
# `Jekyll::StaticFile#write` time (Jekyll's normal static-file write pass).
